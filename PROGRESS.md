# Multiplayer Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed (Commits 1-4)

### Infrastructure
- Supabase client setup with mojimoji project
- Database tables: `game_rooms` and `room_players`
- Environment variables properly configured

### Room Creation Flow
- Home page with START NEW GAME button
- Room creation in database with unique IDs
- Creator automatically added as Player 1
- SessionStorage tracking for room creators

### Lobby System  
- `/room/{roomId}` route for game lobbies
- Different views for creator vs joiner
- COPY GAME LINK functionality
- Player 2 auto-joins when visiting shared link
- Players stored in database

## 🚧 In Progress

### Missing Features
- **Realtime updates** - Creator doesn't see when Player 2 joins
- **ADMIT system** - Creator should approve Player 2
- **Game start** - Transition from lobby to actual game
- **Score sync** - Multiplayer game state

## 📝 Current Flow

1. Player 1 visits home → clicks START NEW GAME
2. Room created in DB → redirects to `/room/{roomId}`
3. Player 1 sees "Share this game" + COPY GAME LINK button
4. Player 2 visits shared link → auto-joins as Player 2
5. Player 2 sees "Waiting for Player 1 to let you in..."
6. ❌ Player 1 doesn't see Player 2 joined (no realtime yet)

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. Enable Supabase Realtime on tables
2. Subscribe to room_players changes in lobby
3. Add ADMIT button when Player 2 joins
4. Implement START GAME functionality
5. Sync game state between players

## 🐛 Known Issues

- No realtime updates between players
- No way to remove/kick players
- No timeout for abandoned rooms
- START GAME button doesn't work yet
