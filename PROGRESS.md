4. Player 2 visits shared link → auto-joins as Player 2
5. Player 1 sees join request → clicks ADMIT to approve
6. Both players ready → START GAME begins synchronized play
7. Real-time puzzle sync, scoring, and winner detection
8. All data persisted to Supabase for reliability

## 🎤 Voice Recognition Improvements (Sept 6, 2025)

### Major Changes: Toggle Recording Mode
- **Changed from push-to-talk to toggle mode** - Click to start, click to stop (much better for mobile!)
- **Fixed auto-stopping bug** - Set `continuous: true` so recording doesn't stop when user pauses
- **Improved UI feedback**:
  - 🟢 Green = Recording
  - 🟠 Orange = Starting microphone  
  - 🟡 Amber = Processing speech
- **Performance optimizations** - Removed excessive logging that was causing slowdowns

### Critical Learnings
#### ❌ **NEVER DO QUICK FIXES LIKE THIS:**
- Added 2-second artificial delay for Safari → Made UX terrible!
- Used sessionStorage for Safari → Clears on navigation
- Appended transcripts → Caused duplicates like "Ocean eyesOcean eyes"
- Excessive console logging → Serious performance impact

#### ✅ **PROPER SOLUTIONS:**
- Let Safari initialize at its natural speed (no artificial delays!)
- Use localStorage for permission persistence
- Replace transcripts instead of appending
- Minimal, targeted debug logging only

### Results
- **Chrome Desktop**: Fast and smooth ✅
- **Safari Desktop**: Working with natural init delay ✅
- **Mobile**: Ready for testing (next step)

### Technical Details
- `useVoiceRecognition.ts`: Removed Safari delay, set continuous: true
- `AnswerInput.tsx`: Implemented toggle behavior with proper UI states
- Added 'starting' state to differentiate from 'processing'
- Fixed localStorage permission loading

**KEY LESSON: Don't add artificial delays or "workarounds" - fix the root cause!**
